This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#Frontend

The frontend is divided into two files, they are built using react, after installing npm or yarn on the machine, navigate to the file and run npm/yarn install.

The package.json file has the proxy adress, the api calls are set up using the proxy, as such the proxy will need to change based on the backend url. Once everything is set up that's it.
